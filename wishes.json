And last but not least - I've worked with hundreds of people over the years and I can honestly say that you were one of them. Just kidding. 😄 All jokes aside, thank you for being such an incredible colleague. Your help, patience, and sense of humor made even the toughest problems a little more bearable. I’ve learned a lot from working with you, and I genuinely enjoyed every moment of our collaboration. I wish you nothing but success and exciting challenges. Don’t be a stranger and remember, if something breaks mysteriously, I’ll still probably think of you first. Good luck and all the best in what comes next!"

    "message": "To start off, thank you for all the help, guidance, and unwavering support throughout the entire Staubli project, Florent! You were truly an invaluable team member and teammate - someone we could always rely on, no matter the challenge. We faced plenty of difficulties along the way, but you consistently found a way to lighten the mood when things got tough. That made a bigger difference than you probably realise. You were like glue that kept the team together. I’ve learned an incredible amount from you, far more than I could ever count, and those lessons will stay with me well beyond this project. Your professionalism, dedication, and positive attitude set a standard that inspired every one of us. It has been a genuine privilege to work alongside you for so long and to share both the hard-fought victories and the moments of laughter in-between. Sadly all good things do come to an end, however as a famous quote from The Lord of the Rings reminds us: \"The end of one adventure is usually the start of another.\" I have no doubt that this next chapter will bring new challenges, successes, and opportunities that suit you perfectly. I wish you nothing but the very best in all your future endeavors. Any team that gets to work with you will be incredibly fortunate just as we were. Hopefully, our paths will cross again someday, but until then, take care, stay well, and keep being the fantastic teammate and person that you are!"

Thank you so much for your patience and understanding along the way. I have no doubt you’ll do an amazing job in your new chapter—I’m betting you’ll even outshine your father’s success in the insurance business! Best of luck!"
