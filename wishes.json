Don’t you think that you will miss us?\nEven worse: You leave before finishing the 2-way ракия/beer-pipe between the North of France and Bulgaria. How will you survive ? How will we survive ?\nNot to mention the Muscadet-pipe between Nantes and Roubaix!!\nFarewell my Friend. You will be missed here, but for sure we will meet again probably in the North of France around a few beers (and a few more, please!)\nAll the best !"

Your help, patience, and sense of humor made even the toughest problems a little more bearable. I’ve learned a lot from working with you, and I genuinely enjoyed every moment of our collaboration. I wish you nothing but success and exciting challenges. Don’t be a stranger and remember, if something breaks mysteriously, I’ll still probably think of you first.\nGood luck and all the best in what comes next! P.S. Just when I learnt how to pronounce you name correctly.."

I honestly lost count of how many times you helped us, and I’m still convinced you had some kind of cheat code for staying positive.\nI’ve worked with plenty of people on different projects, but you’re definitely one of the rare ones who made work feel less like… well, work. A small part of me is still waiting for you to say, \"Relax, it’s just a joke,\" and show up next year like nothing happened. But since you’re actually leaving us for real (rude), I want to wish you the best of luck in your new job.\nPlease don’t stop being the ridiculously positive, always‑ready‑to‑help, good‑energy‑charging human you are. Your new team has no idea how lucky they are - they’re basically getting a limited‑edition model.\nSo good luck on your new adventure. And remember: if you ever miss us, get bored, or realize your new coworkers don’t laugh at your jokes as much as we did… just come back. We won’t even pretend to be surprised."

You were truly an invaluable team member and teammate - someone we could always rely on, no matter the challenge. We faced plenty of difficulties along the way, but you consistently found a way to lighten the mood when things got tough. That made a bigger difference than you probably realise. You were like glue that kept the team together.\nI’ve learned an incredible amount from you, far more than I could ever count, and those lessons will stay with me well beyond this project. Your professionalism, dedication, and positive attitude set a standard that inspired every one of us. It has been a genuine privilege to work alongside you for so long and to share both the hard-fought victories and the moments of laughter in-between.\nSadly all good things do come to an end, however as a famous quote from The Lord of the Rings reminds us: \"The end of one adventure is usually the start of another.\" I have no doubt that this next chapter will bring new challenges, successes, and opportunities that suit you perfectly.\nI wish you nothing but the very best in all your future endeavors. Any team that gets to work with you will be incredibly fortunate just as we were. Hopefully, our paths will cross again someday, but until then, take care, stay well, and keep being the fantastic teammate and person that you are!"
