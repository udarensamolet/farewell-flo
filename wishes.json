And last but not least - I've worked with hundreds of people over the years and I can honestly say that you were one of them. Just kidding. 😄 All jokes aside, thank you for being such an incredible colleague. Your help, patience, and sense of humor made even the toughest problems a little more bearable. I’ve learned a lot from working with you, and I genuinely enjoyed every moment of our collaboration. I wish you nothing but success and exciting challenges. Don’t be a stranger and remember, if something breaks mysteriously, I’ll still probably think of you first."
